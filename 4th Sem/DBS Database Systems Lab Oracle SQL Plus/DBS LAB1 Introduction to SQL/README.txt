On page 10(Page 10 of DBS Lab Manual **pdf** document), there is a wrong example command given.
Question 6 says to truncate table and command is given is 'Trunc' - which is wrong.
The correct command is 'TRUNCATE' not 'trun'.

Also on page 10, DML commands 1b'List age of all students with column aliased as ‘student_age’ rather stu_age';
The correct command is "SELECT stu_age AS student_age FROM STUDENT;"
what it does-
AS student_age: This gives an alias (student_age) to the stu_age column in the result set. Instead of displaying the column name as stu_age, it will be displayed as student_age in the output.

DML Commands 1c too there is missing 'AS'.
