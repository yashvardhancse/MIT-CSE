If you face problems or can't see output then try adjusting the delay value in c code.
For e.g. you may set delay from 12000 to 14000 or 20000, depending on your system,
you may get output at different delay value.

Just focus on .c file, rest files like .hex are automatically created by keil when you build and translate the project.

Follow the initial instructions as given in lab manual(lab6) about keil and project directory structure.
You may ignore some flash magic instructions as given in lab manual, as they're not accurate.
