FOR LAB8
Its not mentioned in lab manual instructions.
For solved exercise, you need two 10 core FRC cables.
Connect them from CNB to CNB1 and other cable from CNAD to CND.

For question 1 i.e. die tossing, you need three 10 core FRC cables.
Connect CNB to CNB1 
Connect CNAD to CND 
Connect CND1 to CNA

Save header file as .h, the other main file as .c; your header file should be in same directory/folder as your c file.

 
If you face problems or can't see output then try adjusting the delay value in c code.
For e.g. you may set delay from 12000 to 14000 or 20000, depending on your system,
you may get output at different delay value.

Just focus on .c file, rest files like .hex are automatically created by keil when you build and translate the project.

Follow the initial instructions as given in lab manual(lab6) about keil and project directory structure.
You may ignore some flash magic instructions as given in lab manual, as they're not accurate.
